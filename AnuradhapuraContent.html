It is very famous among Buddhists pilgrims. Anuradhapura was earlier the capital of the Island (in ancient times) and most of the Kings who ruled Sri Lanka resided in this vast city. The city is now named as a world heritage site by UNESCO.</p></form>

	<font  style="color:#4f4f4f; font-size:130%; font-family:Roboto; text-align:right"><b>History Anuradhapura</b></font>
	<p style="text-align:justify ">On the contrary to the historical data that indicates that the city is founded in the 5 century BC archeological data puts that date back to far as the 10 century BC. However it was King Pandukabhaya who planned the layout of the city and made it his capital in the 4th century BC. He constructed many reservoirs and shrines. The city reached its highest magnificence by the beginning of the Christian era. The city boasted some of the most complex irrigation systems in the ancient world.</p>
	
	<font  style="color:#4f4f4f; font-size:130%; font-family:Roboto; text-align:right"><b>The ruins in Anuradhapura</b></font>
	<p style="text-align:justify ">Ruins are the only remains of what Anuradhapura used to be. Ruins generally have three classes of buildings:<br>1.Dagobas ( bell-shaped masses of masonry)<br>2.Monastic Buildings<br>3.Pokunas ( bathing tanks/ tanks that supply water for drinking)</p>

	<font  style="color:#4f4f4f; font-size:130%; font-family:Roboto; text-align:right"><b>Abhayagiri Dagoba</b></font><p style="text-align:justify ">Dating back to the 1st century BC, this colossal dagoba was the ceremonial focus of the 5000-strong Abhayagiri Monastery. Originally over 100m high, it was one of the greatest structures in the ancient world, its scale only matched by the pyramids of Giza (and nearby Jetavanarama). Today, after several reconstructions, Abhayagiri Dagoba soars 75m above the forest floor. Visually, it's stunning, and your first glimpse of this brick monument through a gap in the surrounding forest is breathtaking.The name means ‘Hill of Protection’ or ‘Fearless Hill’. The Saddarma Rathnawaliya scripture records that a statue of a golden bull containing relics of the Buddha was buried in the core of the stupa.Abhayagiri Dagoba has some interesting bas-reliefs, including one near the western stairway of an elephant pulling up a tree. A large slab with a Buddha footprint can be seen on the northern side, and the eastern and western steps have unusual moonstones made from concentric stone slabs (the word 'moonstone' relates to the shape of the stone, not the type of stone itself). As you walk around the northern side of the stupa, look for the octagonal yupa (spire) and shaft that originally topped the dagoba before the current square top was added.</p>
	
	<font  style="color:#4f4f4f; font-size:130%; font-family:Roboto; text-align:right"><b>Ruvanvelisaya Dagoba</b></font><p style="text-align:justify ">This magnificent white dagoba is guarded by a wall with a frieze of 344 elephants standing shoulder to shoulder. Apart from a few beside the western entrance, most are modern replacements of the originals from 140 BC. Today, after incurring much damage from invading Indian forces, it rises 55m, considerably less than its original height; nor is its form the same as the earlier ‘bubble’ shape. During the dagoba's consecration, a portion of Buddha's ashes were allegedly enshrined here, in a grand ceremony attended by monks from Rajagriha, Vaishali, Patna, Kashmir and Afghanistan. At the time, it was the biggest stupa in the world, with a 7m-deep foundation made of limestone broken with hammers and then crushed by elephants.Ruvanvelisaya was commissioned by King Dutugemunu, but he didn’t live to see its completion. However, as he lay on his deathbed, a false bamboo-and-cloth finish was placed around the dagoba so that Dutugemunu’s final sight could be of his ‘completed’ masterpiece. A limestone statue in a small pavilion south of the great dagoba is popularly thought to be of Dutugemunu.The land around the dagoba is dotted with the remains of ponds and pools, and collections of columns and pillars, all picturesquely leaning in different directions. Slightly southeast of the dagoba, en route to the Sri Maha Bodhi Temple, you can see one of Anuradhapura’s many monks’ refectories.</p>
	
	<font  style="color:#4f4f4f; font-size:130%; font-family:Roboto; text-align:right"><b>Sri Maha Bodhi</b></font><p style="text-align:justify ">The sacred bodhi tree is central to Anuradhapura in both a spiritual and physical sense. It was grown from a cutting brought from Bodhgaya in India and is said to be the oldest historically authenticated tree in the world, tended by an uninterrupted succession of guardians for over 2000 years. Today thousands of devotees come to make offerings, particularly on poya (full moon) days and weekends. Sunset is a magical time to visit. The faithful believe it was Princess Sangamitta, daughter of the Indian Emperor Ashoka and sister of Mahinda (who introduced Buddhism to Sri Lanka), who brought the cutting from India. These days there is not one but many bodhi trees here; the oldest and holiest stands on the top platform. Railing and other structures around the trees are festooned with prayer flags.In 1985, during the civil war, Tamil Tigers opened fire in the enclosure, killing several worshippers as part of a larger offensive that took the lives of almost 150 civilians.April and December are particularly busy months as pilgrims converge on the site for snana puja (offerings or prayers).</p>
	
	<font  style="color:#4f4f4f; font-size:130%; font-family:Roboto; text-align:right"><b>Jetavanarama Dagoba</b></font><p style="text-align:justify ">The Jetavanarama Dagoba’s massive dome rises above the entire eastern part of Anuradhapura. Built in the 3rd century by King Mahasena, it may have originally topped 120m, but today is about 70m – similar to the Abhayagiri. When it was built it was almost certainly the third-tallest monument in the world, the first two being Egyptian pyramids. Its vast, bulbous form is unplastered and said to consist of more than 90 million bricks. A British guidebook from the early 1900s calculated that this was enough bricks to make a 3m-high wall stretching from London to Edinburgh.Around it stand the ruins of a monastery that housed 3000 monks. One building has door jambs over 8m high still standing, with another 3m still buried underground. This area was once part of an ancient pleasure park called Nandana Uyana, said to be the site of the first sermons on Buddhism preached by Mahinda in the 3rd century BC.</p>
	
	<font  style="color:#4f4f4f; font-size:130%; font-family:Roboto; text-align:right"><b>Archaeological Museum</b></font><p style="text-align:justify ">The old British colonial administration building has recently been renovated and has an interesting collection of artwork, carvings and everyday items from Anuradhapura and other historic sites around Sri Lanka. Exhibits include a restored relic chamber, found during the excavation of the Kantaka Chetiya dagoba at nearby Mihintale, and a large-scale model of Thuparama Dagoba’s vatadage (circular relic house) as it might have been if a wooden roof had existed.</p>
	
	<font  style="color:#4f4f4f; font-size:130%; font-family:Roboto; text-align:right"><b>Anuradhapura World Heritage Site</b></font><p style="text-align:justify ">The ruins of Anuradhapura are one of South Asia’s most evocative sights. The sprawling complex contains a rich collection of archaeological and architectural wonders: enormous dagobas (brick stupas), ancient pools and crumbling temples, built during Anuradhapura’s thousand years as capital of Sri Lanka.</p>
	
	<font  style="color:#4f4f4f; font-size:130%; font-family:Roboto; text-align:right"><b>Isurumuniya Vihara</b></font><p style="text-align:justify ">This charming rock temple, dating from the reign of Devanampiya Tissa (r 307–267 BC), is set around a lovely lotus pond, the corner of which is carved with images of elephants playfully splashing water. The central temple has some particularly fine mural paintings. Climb around the back to the rock summit to see the bell-shaped stupa and a pair of Buddha footprints etched into the rock. The small museum features the famous ‘lovers’ sculpture, which dates from around the 5th century AD and is carved in the artistic style of the Indian Gupta dynasty of the 4th and 5th centuries. Photos are tolerated, despite signs to the contrary.</p>
	
	<font  style="color:#4f4f4f; font-size:130%; font-family:Roboto; text-align:right"><b>Ratnaprasada</b></font><p style="text-align:justify ">Most of the 8th-century Ratnaprasada or 'Jewel Palace' lies in ruins today, though it was originally seven storeys high with a graceful, tiered roof. The entrance is marked by a beautifully carved muragala (guardstone), which depicts the Cobra King holding a vase of abundance and a flowering branch, with a dwarf attendant at his feet and his head framed by a cobra hood. RatnaprasadaThe monks of Ratnaprasada monastery often gave sanctuary to people in trouble with the authorities, and this led to a major conflict with the king. When court officials at odds with the king took sanctuary in the Ratnaprasada, the king sent his supporters to capture and execute them. The monks, disgusted at this invasion of a sacred place, departed en masse. The general populace, equally disgusted, besieged the Ratnaprasada, captured and executed the king’s supporters and forced the king to apologise to the departed monks in order to bring the monks back to the city and restore peace.To the south of the Ratnaprasada is the Lankarama, a 1st-century-BC dagoba.</p>
	
	<font  style="color:#4f4f4f; font-size:130%; font-family:Roboto; text-align:right"><b>Sandahiru Seya</b></font><p style="text-align:justify ">wo thousand years after the first of the great dagobas was constructed, a huge new stupa, the Sandahiru Seya, is rising on the south side of Anuradhapura, commissioned by President Rajapaksa in 2010. Designed to reach 85m in height, with a circumference of 244m, it will eventually rise above the ancient dagobas of Jetavanarama and Abhayagiri (but will not surpass their original heights). Sandahiru Seya is being constructed from over 30 million bricks and will be plastered and then whitewashed when finished. Controversially, this is just one of nine new stupas planned, on orders of the president 'in appreciation of the noble service rendered by the armed forces and police to defeat terrorism and bring lasting peace to the country'. However, some have objected to the principle of dedicating a Buddhist monument to the actions of the Sri Lankan military. The pace of construction and flow of funds has slowed in recent years, so it could be many years before the huge dagoba is finished.</p>
	
	<font  style="color:#4f4f4f; font-size:130%; font-family:Roboto; text-align:right"><b>Thuparama Dagoba</b></font><p style="text-align:justify ">In a beautiful woodland setting north of the Ruvanvelisaya Dagoba, the Thuparama Dagoba is the oldest dagoba in Sri Lanka – indeed, probably the oldest visible dagoba in the world. It was constructed by King Devanampiya Tissa in the 3rd century BC and is said to enshrine the right collarbone of the Buddha. Its ‘heap-of-paddy-rice’ shape was restored in 1862 to a more conventional bell shape and to a height of 19m. The slender, capital-topped pillars of the surrounding vatadage (circular relic house), perhaps the dagoba’s most unique feature, enclose the structure in four concentric circles. Impressions on the dagoba pediments indicate the pillars originally numbered 176, of which 41 still stand. Although some Sri Lankan scholars believe these once supported a conical wooden roof, there is no archaeological evidence or precedent for this theory.</p>
	
	<font  style="color:#4f4f4f; font-size:130%; font-family:Roboto; text-align:right"><b>Royal Pleasure Gardens</b></font><p style="text-align:justify ">Known as the Park of the Goldfish, these extensive 2000-year-old royal pleasure gardens cover 14 hectares and contain two ponds skilfully designed to fit around the huge boulders in the park. Look out for the fine elephant carvings. Carved onto the back side of a rock face in the southwest corner of the park is an intriguing geometric mandala design of circles and crosses that some have suggested is one of the earliest ever depictions of a world map.It was here that Prince Saliya, the son of Dutugemunu, was said to have met the low-caste Asokamala, whom he married, thereby forsaking his right to the throne, a story captured in the 'lover's' sculpture in nearby Isurumuniya Vihara.</p>
	
	<font  style="color:#4f4f4f; font-size:130%; font-family:Roboto; text-align:right"><b>Kuttam Pokuna</b></font><p style="text-align:justify ">These swimming-pool-like ponds were likely used by monks from nearby Kaparamula residence hall. Water entered the larger pond through the mouth of a makara (a mythical hybrid beast featuring the body of a fish, the mouth of a crocodile and the trunk of an elephant) and then flowed to the smaller pond through an underground pipe. Note the five-headed cobra figure close to the makara and the nearby water-filter system, both at the northwestern end of the ponds. Although they are referred to as twins, the northern pond, which is 28m in length, is smaller than the 40m-long southern pond.</p>
	
	<font  style="color:#4f4f4f; font-size:130%; font-family:Roboto; text-align:right"><b>Jetavanarama Museum</b></font><p style="text-align:justify ">A 1937 British colonial building provides a suitably regal venue for some of the treasures found at Jetavanarama. The objects displayed here range from the sublime (finely carved ivory finials) to the ridiculous (ancient toilet pipes). Highlights include the elaborately carved urinal in Room 1 and the tiny 8mm-long gold decoration featuring eight exquisite flowers in Room 2. A series of interesting B&emp;W photos show the site's dagobas covered in jungle when they were first rediscovered. The monastery ruins just outside the museum building include a photogenic water tank and several raised platforms.</p>
	
	<font  style="color:#4f4f4f; font-size:130%; font-family:Roboto; text-align:right"><b>Mirisavatiya Dagoba</b></font><p style="text-align:justify ">This huge dagoba was the first built by King Dutugemunu after he recaptured the city in the 2nd century BC. The story goes that Dutugemunu went to bathe in the tank, leaving his ornate sceptre implanted in the bank. When he emerged he found his sceptre, which contained a relic of the Buddha, impossible to pull out. Taking this as an auspicious sign, he had the dagoba built. Mirisavatiya Dagoba is one of three interesting sites (along with the Isurumuniya Vihara and Royal Pleasure Gardens) that can be visited in a stroll or bike ride along the banks of the Tissa Wewa.</p>
	
	<font  style="color:#4f4f4f; font-size:130%; font-family:Roboto; text-align:right"><b>Moonstone</b></font><p style="text-align:justify ">Sitting northwest of the Abhayagiri Dagoba, this ruined 9th-century residential complex for monks is notable for having the finest carved moonstone in Sri Lanka; see how many species of animals you can find in its elaborate carvings. This is a peaceful wooded area full of butterflies, and makes a good place to stop and cool off during a tour of the ruins (there are drink and snack stands close by). Look for the fine steps held up by jovial gana (dwarfs). It forms part of a structure often mistakenly described as Mahasena’s Palace or the Queen’s Pavilion.</p>
	
	<font  style="color:#4f4f4f; font-size:130%; font-family:Roboto; text-align:right"><b>Abhayagiri Museum</b></font><p style="text-align:justify ">This museum, south of the Abhayagiri Dagoba, is arguably the most interesting in Anuradhapura and contains a collection of squatting plates, jewellery, pottery and religious sculpture from the site. There's a lot of information about the many monuments of Anuradhapura, and a small bookshop The Chinese-funded building commemorates the 5th-century visit of Chinese Buddhist monk Fa Xian to Anuradhapura. Fa Xian spent two years (412–13 AD) living at Abhayagiri, translating Buddhist texts that he later carried back to China along the Silk Route.</p>
	
	<font  style="color:#4f4f4f; font-size:130%; font-family:Roboto; text-align:right"><b>Eth Pokuna</b></font><p style="text-align:justify ">Surrounded by forest, this huge body of water is thought to have acted as an ancient water storage tank for the Abhayagiri monastery rather than as a pool for pachyderms. Such is the scale of the tank – 159m long, 53m wide and 10m deep – that six Olympic-sized swimming pools could comfortably fit inside it. Underground channels from the Periyamkulama Tank keep the pond topped up, and are still in working order – during very heavy rains water pours into the pond from inlets.</p>
	
	<font  style="color:#4f4f4f; font-size:130%; font-family:Roboto; text-align:right"><b>Samadhi Buddha</b></font><p style="text-align:justify ">This 4th-century statue, seated in the samadhi (meditation) pose, is regarded as one of the finest Buddha statues in Sri Lanka. When constructed, it was likely one of four statues placed at the cardinal directions. Jawaharlal Nehru, a prominent leader in India’s independence movement and its first prime minister, is said to have maintained his composure while imprisoned by the British by regular contemplation of a photo of this statue.</p>
	
	<font  style="color:#4f4f4f; font-size:130%; font-family:Roboto; text-align:right"><b>Kaparamula</b></font><p style="text-align:justify ">This mula, or college, housed the bulk of Anuradhapura's many foreign monks and it was probably here that Chinese pilgrim Fa Xian spent two years studying Buddhist Sanskrit texts. Archaeological digs are still under way, allowing you to see the brick foundations emerge from the forest soil. </p>
	
	<font  style="color:#4f4f4f; font-size:130%; font-family:Roboto; text-align:right"><b>Alms Hall</b></font><p style="text-align:justify ">To the southwest of the Abhayagiri Dagoba this small site has a 19m-long stone batnava (or rice canoe) that would have been filled daily with cooked rice to feed Abhayagiri's thousands of monks. To the west are the remains of a kitchen and a smaller stone canoe used for curry. </p>
	
	<font  style="color:#4f4f4f; font-size:130%; font-family:Roboto; text-align:right"><b>Padhanagara</b></font><p style="text-align:justify ">Beyond the main Abhayagiri site are the scattered ruins of the western monasteries, set up by ascetic monks. With a bike you can track down some of these little-visited ruins, including this former meditation centre and its wonderfully carved squat toilet.</p>
	
	<font  style="color:#4f4f4f; font-size:130%; font-family:Roboto; text-align:right"><b>Nuwara Wewa</b></font><p style="text-align:justify ">Nuwara Wewa, on the east side of the city, is the largest tank in Anuradhapura, covering about 12 sq km. It was built around 20 BC and is well away from most of the old city. The northwestern corner offers spectacular sunset views of the old city.</p>
	
	<font  style="color:#4f4f4f; font-size:130%; font-family:Roboto; text-align:right"><b>Lankarama Dagoba</b></font><p style="text-align:justify ">To the south of the Ratnaprasada is this whitewashed 1st-century-BC dagoba.</p>
	
	<font  style="color:#4f4f4f; font-size:130%; font-family:Roboto; text-align:right"><b>Lowamahapaya</b></font><p style="text-align:justify ">So called because it once had a bronze-tiled roof, the ruins of the 'Brazen Palace' stand close to the bodhi tree. The remains of 1600 columns are all that is left of this huge pavilion, said to have had nine storeys and accommodation for 1000 monks and attendants.It was originally built by King Dutugemunu more than 2000 years ago, but through the ages was rebuilt many times, each time a little less grandiosely. The current stand of pillars (now fenced off) is all that remains from the last rebuild – that of King Parakramabahu I around the 12th century.</p>
	
	<font  style="color:#4f4f4f; font-size:130%; font-family:Roboto; text-align:right"><b>Vessagiriya</b></font><p style="text-align:justify ">South of the Isurumuniya Vihara are the faint remains of the Vessagiriya cave monastery, a series of evocative, gravity-defying boulder overhangs etched with inscriptions and water channels. You can easily picture monks meditating in their cave retreats here.</p>
	
	<font  style="color:#4f4f4f; font-size:130%; font-family:Roboto; text-align:right"><b>Royal Palace</b></font><p style="text-align:justify ">Built in 1070 (some 12 centuries after Anuradhapura’s heyday), this palace was an attempt by King Vijayabahu I to link his reign with the glories of the ancient Sinhalese capital. Little remains today except two fine, but surprisingly modest, guardstones.</p>
	
	<font  style="color:#4f4f4f; font-size:130%; font-family:Roboto; text-align:right"><b>Dakkhina Stupa</b></font><p style="text-align:justify ">Most tourists ignore this 2000-year-old stupa, but legend says it holds the cremated remains of King Dutugemunu (r 161–137 BC). It's now mostly used by troops of langur monkeys sunning themselves in the afternoon light.</p>
	
	<font  style="color:#4f4f4f; font-size:130%; font-family:Roboto; text-align:right"><b>Tissa Wewa</b></font><p style="text-align:justify ">The 160-hectare Tissa Wewa is the southern tank in the old city. The dirt road around the lake makes for a nice bike ride. It's easily accessed from the behind the Isurumuniya Vihara or Royal Pleasure Gardens.</p>
	
	<font  style="color:#4f4f4f; font-size:130%; font-family:Roboto; text-align:right"><b>Mahapali Refectory</b></font><p style="text-align:justify ">The Mahapali refectory, or alms hall, is notable mainly for its immense trough (nearly 3m long and 2m wide) that the lay followers filled with rice for the monks.</p>
	
	<font  style="color:#4f4f4f; font-size:130%; font-family:Roboto; text-align:right"><b>Folk Museum</b></font><p style="text-align:justify ">A short distance north of the Archaeological Museum is this dusty museum with mildly interesting exhibits of country life in Sri Lanka’s North Central Province.</p>
	
	<font  style="color:#4f4f4f; font-size:130%; font-family:Roboto; text-align:right"><b>Basawak Kulama</b></font><p style="text-align:justify ">The oldest tank in Anuradhapura, probably dating from around the 4th century BC, is the 120-hectare Basawak Kulama (the Tamil word for tank is kulam).</p>
	
	<font  style="color:#4f4f4f; font-size:130%; font-family:Roboto; text-align:right"><b>Buddhist Railing</b></font><p style="text-align:justify ">A little south of the Jetavanarama Dagoba, on the other side of the road, there is a stone railing built in imitation of a log wall.
